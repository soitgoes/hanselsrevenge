    <h1>Back Story</h1>
    <p>For those that are unfamiliar with the story of <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Hansel and Gretel</a>. Hansel was a clever chap and when he heard of his evil stepmother's plan he gathered pebbles so that he could find his way back from the forest.  This worked and he and his sister were able to return safely from the depths of the forrest.  However, on the second attempt his step mother locked them in a room the day proir to leading them out in the forest and all Hansel had was breadcrumbs to find his way back out of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crows ate his breadcrumb trail back to the house and thwarted his return to his loving father and you know the rest.  What you don't know is that Hansel has always held a grudge against crows for destroying the trail he had so carefully laid.  This is the story of <a href="story.htm">Hansel's revenge</a>.
